## Introductory Problems

### Weird Algorithm
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer `n`. If `n` is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if `n` is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until `n` is one. Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of `n`. 

**Input**: The only input line contains an integer `n`. (Example: 3)

**Output**: Print a line that contains all values of `n` during the algorithm. (Example: 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1)

### Missing Number
You are given all numbers between `1, 2, ..., n` except one. Your task is to find the missing number.

**Input**: The first input line contains an integer `n`. The second input line contains `n - 1` numbers. Each number is distinct and between 1 and `n` (inclusive). (Example: 5`\n`2 3 1 5)

**Output**: Print the missing number. (Example: 4)
