## Introductory Problems

### Weird Algorithm
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer `n`. If `n` is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if `n` is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until `n` is one. Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of `n`. 

**Input**: The only input line contains an integer `n`. (Example: 3)

**Output**: Print a line that contains all values of `n` during the algorithm. (Example: 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1)
